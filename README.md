# CS: Artificial-Intelligence
Friends,

I am currently a senior in high school, and I am taking an independent study on artificial intelligence. I am using the textbook 'Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach' to learn the material, and my faculty advisor gives me projects to test my knowledge.

**Projects**
1) Post Correspondence Problem (Named DominoProblem in code repo)
