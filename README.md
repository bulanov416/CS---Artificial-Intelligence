# CS: Artificial-Intelligence
Friends,

I am currently a senior in high school, and I am taking an independent study on artificial intelligence. I am using the textbook 'Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach' to learn the material, and my faculty advisor gives me projects to test my knowledge. All code found in this repo is written by me for this independent study. Enjoy!

**Projects**
1) Post Correspondence Problem (Named DominoProblem in code repo)
2) Minimax search algorithm (Named AdversarialSearchProject in code repo)
